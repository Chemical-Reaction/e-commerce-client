# Planning
  First we worked on the user stories, and what we wanted our users to experience while using our application. Then, we worked on our wireframes for our e-commerce store to get an idea of what we wanted our application to look like. Next, we created our Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in which we mapped out our models which include users, orders, and products. We used pair programming and mob programming during creating this application, and were able to problem solve successfully due to collaborating on different elements of our project.

# User stories
  1. User is able to view products without being signed in.
  2. In order to place item in cart, customer will need to create an account.
  3. Customer will create an account by signing up and signing in.
  4. User will be able to change password after signing in and have the option of signing out.
  5. User will be able to add items to cart from product list.
  6. User will be able to delete items from cart.
  7. User will be able to checkout cart with stipe pay and the order will be archived to their order history.
